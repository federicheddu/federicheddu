# Hi there <a href="https://www.github.com/federicheddu"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a>
Hello, I am **Federico Meloni** and I am a **master’s student in computer science** at the **University of Cagliari**. The internet world knows me as **federicheddu**.  
During my studies I developed an interest in **computer graphics** (main focus of both my bachelor’s and master’s thesis) and **human-computer interaction**.  
In my time at the university I also had the opportunity to explore other fields such as computer vision and deep learning, although they are not my main focus.


### Experiences:
- lots of university projects *(many of which you can find on this profile)*
- internship and research grant at the CG3HCI Lab. at the University of Cagliari
- tutor of Programming 1 and Video Game Design courses, where I taught the basics of imperative programming in C and rudiments of Unity Engine at University of Cagliari
